# Voice-Based Hot and Cold Water Dispenser 💧🎤

A smart IoT mini-project that uses voice commands (via Google Assistant) to control the flow of hot and cold water using ESP8266, relay modules, and a simple switching mechanism.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- Relay Module
- Arduino IDE
- Google Assistant + IFTTT
- Power Supply and Water Valves

## 💡 Project Overview
This system eliminates the need for manual interaction with water dispensers. It is especially useful in hospitals, elderly care, and during COVID-like hygiene-conscious environments.

## 🎯 Features
- Dispense hot or cold water by voice
- Touchless and hygienic
- Real-time switching via Wi-Fi
- Presentation-ready prototype
